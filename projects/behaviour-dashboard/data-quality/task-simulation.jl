RELMED - Task Simulation
========================
This module contains functions to simulate task performance for trial I of RELMED.
It includes simulations of random agents for the reversal learning task, probabilistic instrumental learning task (PILT),
and working memory task. Critical accuracy thresholds under the null hypothesis are calculated based on the simulations.
